# Conway's Game of Life in Rust!

This is my first attempt at making something real in Rust, built using various Rust nightlies in the month or so
leading up to the first stable release. 

It has a 128x96 grid, wrapping on both axes, and rendered using OpenGL, with [glium](http://github.com/tomaka/glium).

Run it with `cargo run`.

The code looks OK to me, but I'm still learning the basics of Rust, so I'd be keen to get any feed back (or even pull
requests!) to help me improve the code :)
